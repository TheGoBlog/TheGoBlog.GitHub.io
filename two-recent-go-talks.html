  <h4 id="TOC_1.">Introduction</h4>
  <p>Late last year I wrote a couple of Go talks and presented them at <a href="http://thestrangeloop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strange Loop</a>,
<a href="http://oredev.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Øredev</a>, and various other venues.
The talks are designed to give insight into the practice of Go programming,
each describing the construction of a real program and demonstrating the
power and depth of the Go language and its libraries and tools.</p>
<p>The following videos are, in my opinion, the best recordings of these talks.</p>


    
      
  <h4 id="TOC_2.">Go: a simple programming environment</h4>
  <p>Go is a general-purpose language that bridges the gap between efficient
statically typed languages and productive dynamic language.
But it’s not just the language that makes Go special – Go has broad
and consistent standard libraries and powerful but simple tools.</p>
<p>This talk gives an introduction to Go, followed by a tour of some real programs
that demonstrate the power,
scope, and simplicity of the Go programming environment.</p>

  <h4 id="TOC_3.">Go: code that grows with grace</h4>
  <p>One of Go&#39;s key design goals is code adaptability;
that it should be easy to take a simple design and build upon it in a clean and natural way.
In this talk I describe a simple &#34;chat roulette&#34; server that matches pairs
of incoming TCP connections,
and then use Go&#39;s concurrency mechanisms,
interfaces, and standard library to extend it with a web interface and other features.
While the function of the program changes dramatically,
Go&#39;s flexibility preserves the original design as it grows.</p>
