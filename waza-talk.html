        <p>If there&#39;s one thing most people know about Go,
is that it is designed for concurrency.
No introduction to Go is complete without a demonstration of its goroutines and channels.</p>
<p>But when people hear the word <em>concurrency</em> they often think of <em>parallelism</em>,
a related but quite distinct concept.
In programming, concurrency is the <em>composition</em> of independently executing processes,
while parallelism is the simultaneous <em>execution</em> of (possibly related) computations.
Concurrency is about <em>dealing with</em> lots of things at once.
Parallelism is about <em>doing</em> lots of things at once.</p>
<p>To clear up this conflation, Rob Pike gave a talk at <a href="http://heroku.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heroku</a>&#39;s
<a href="http://waza.heroku.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Waza</a> conference entitled <em>Concurrency is not parallelism</em>,
and a video recording of the talk was released a few months ago.</p>
