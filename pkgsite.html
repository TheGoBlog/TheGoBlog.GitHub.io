  <h4 id="TOC_1."></h4>
  <p>We’re excited to announce that the codebase for
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pkg.go.dev</a> is now open source.</p>
<p>The repository lives at
<a href="https://go.googlesource.com/pkgsite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go.googlesource.com/pkgsite</a>
and is mirrored to
<a href="https://github.com/golang/pkgsite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github.com/golang/pkgsite</a>.
We will continue using the Go issue tracker to track
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/labels/go.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feedback</a>
related to pkg.go.dev.</p>

  <h4 id="TOC_3.">What’s Next</h4>
  <p>We really appreciate all the feedback we’ve received so far. It has been a big
help in shaping our
<a href="https://go.googlesource.com/pkgsite#roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roadmap</a> for the coming year.
Now that pkg.go.dev is open source, here’s what we’ll be working on next:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We have some design changes planned for pkg.go.dev,
to address
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ago.dev+label%3AUX" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UX feedback</a>
that we have received. You can expect a more cohesive search and navigation
experience. We plan to share these designs for feedback once they are ready.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We know that there are features available on godoc.org that users
want to see on pkg.go.dev. We’ve been keeping track of them on
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/39144" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go issue #39144</a>,
and will prioritize adding them in the next few months. We also plan to
continue improving our license detection algorithm based on feedback.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We’ll be improving our search experience based on feedback in
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/37810" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go issue #37810</a>,
to make it easier for users to find the dependencies they are looking for and
make better decisions around which ones to import.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for being patient with us in the process of open sourcing pkg.go.dev.
We’re looking forward to receiving your contributions and working with you on
the future of the project.</p>
