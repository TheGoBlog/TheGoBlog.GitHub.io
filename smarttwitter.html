        <p><em>This week&#39;s article is written by</em> <a href="http://www.hoisie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Michael Hoisie</em></a>.
<em>A programmer based in San Francisco, he is one of Go&#39;s early adopters and the author of several popular Go libraries. He describes his experiences using Go:</em></p>
<p>I was introduced to Go by a post on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hacker News</a>.
About an hour later I was hooked. At the time I was working at a web start-up,
and had been developing internal testing apps in Python.
Go offered speed, better concurrency support,
and sane Unicode handling, so I was keen to port my programs to the language.
At that time there wasn&#39;t an easy way to write web apps in Go,
so I decided to build a simple web framework,
<a href="http://github.com/hoisie/web.go" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web.go</a>.
It was modeled after a popular Python framework,
<a href="http://webpy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web.py</a>, which I had worked with previously.
While working on web.go I got involved in the Go community,
submitted a bunch of bug reports, and hacked on some standard library packages
(mainly <a href="https://golang.google.cn/pkg/http/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http</a> and <a href="https://golang.google.cn/pkg/json/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">json</a>).</p>
<p>After a few weeks I noticed that web.go was getting attention at Github.
This was surprising because I&#39;d never really promoted the project.
I think there&#39;s a niche for simple, fast web applications,
and I think Go can fill it.</p>
<p>One weekend I decided to write a simple Facebook application:
it would re-post your Twitter status updates to your Facebook profile.
There is an official Twitter application to do this,
but it re-posts everything, creating noise in your Facebook feed.
My application allowed you to filter retweets,
mentions, hashtags, replies, and more.
This turned into <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=135488932982" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smart Twitter</a>,
which currently has nearly 90,000 users.</p>
<p>The entire program is written in Go, and uses <a href="https://redis.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redis</a>
as its storage back-end.
It is very fast and robust. It currently processes about two dozen tweets per second,
and makes heavy use of Go&#39;s channels.
It runs on a single Virtual Private Server instance with 2GB of RAM,
which has no problem handling the load.
Smart Twitter uses very little CPU time, and is almost entirely memory-bound
as the entire database is kept in memory.
At any given time there are around 10 goroutines running concurrently:
one accepting HTTP connections, another reading from the Twitter Streaming API,
a couple for error handling, and the rest either processing web requests
or re-posting incoming tweets.</p>
<p>Smart Twitter also spawned other open-source Go projects:
<a href="http://github.com/hoisie/mustache.go" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mustache.go</a>,
<a href="http://github.com/hoisie/redis.go" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redis.go</a>,
and <a href="http://github.com/hoisie/twitterstream" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twitterstream</a>.</p>
<p>I see a lot of work left to do on web.go.
For instance, I&#39;d like to add better support for streaming connections,
websockets, route filters, better support in shared hosts,
and improving the documentation.
I recently left the start-up to do software freelancing,
and I&#39;m planning to use Go where possible.
This means I&#39;ll probably use it as a back end for personal apps,
as well as for clients that like working with cutting edge technology.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#39;d like to thank the Go team for all their effort.
Go is a wonderful platform and I think it has a bright future.
I hope to see the language grow around the needs of the community.
There&#39;s a lot of interesting stuff happening in the community,
and I look forward to seeing what people can hack together with the language.</p>
