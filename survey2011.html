        <p>Over the past couple of years Go has attracted a lot of users and contributors,
and I&#39;ve had a great time meeting and talking with many of you.
However, for every Gopher I know there are dozens I know nothing about.
In order to address this imbalance I&#39;ve prepared a survey for Go users everywhere.</p>
<p>The survey is short. It asks about you, your involvement with Go,
and and your interest in Go-related events.
Among other things, this data will help myself and the rest of the Go team
plan future Go events and schedule conference appearances.</p>
<p>Please take a minute to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&amp;formkey=dFdxOTU1Mm92VFA3eHdkekFPamJjUnc6MQ#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete the survey now</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Andrew</p>
