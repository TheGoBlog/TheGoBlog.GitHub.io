        <p><a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/google-io-2010-now-open-for.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google I/O 2010</a>
is happening next week at the Moscone Centre in San Francisco.
Those of you with tickets will be able to catch some of the Go team both
at I/O and at Bootcamp.
In reverse-chronological order:</p>
<p>Rob Pike and Russ Cox will be presenting a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgVhBThJdXc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go Programming</a>
talk on Thursday at 10.15am.
This session takes a detailed look at how Go differs from other languages
in a practical sense.
Through a series of examples, they will demonstrate various features of
Go and the ways in which they affect program design.</p>
<p>Several members of the Go team will be at the Go cube during Office Hours
on Wednesday between 12pm and 2:30pm.
Come by to have your Go questions answered by the experts.</p>
<p>At Bootcamp on Tuesday at 4.15pm, Andrew Gerrand will be giving an introductory talk about Go.
The session will give an overview of the problems that motivated us to build a new language,
and the ways in which Go addresses those problems.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re coming to I/O, we look forward to seeing you there!</p>
