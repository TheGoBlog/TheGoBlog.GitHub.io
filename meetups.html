        <p>Last week, David Symonds and I each gave talks at Sydney&#39;s Go meetup,
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/golang-syd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">golang-syd</a>.
Dave spoke about <a href="http://talks.godoc.org/github.com/dsymonds/talks/2013-feb-golang-syd/golang-syd.slide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go API design in the context of Protocol Buffers</a>,
and I discussed some neat tricks in the construction of <a href="http://talks.godoc.org/github.com/nf/streak/talk.slide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a small command-line program</a>.
The presentations were short but provoked some good questions and interesting discussion.
Of the 50-odd attendees, most were regular Go programmers and a fair chunk
write Go code professionally. It was a fun night.</p>
<p>It would have been great to see you there but,
statistically, you&#39;re not from Sydney.
Despair not, however, as there are likely some people in your area who either
run a Go meetup or want to start one.</p>
<p>The Go wiki lists <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GoUserGroups" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go user groups</a> around the world,
so if there&#39;s one nearby you should consider going along to the next event.</p>
<p>If not, why not start your own? To gauge interest,
ask around in the <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/114112804251407510571" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go+ Community</a> and
the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">golang-nuts mailing list</a>, and
take a look at this <a href="http://golang.meetup.com/all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of people</a> waiting
for a Go meetup in their area.
Once you have a few people interested - and at least one person willing
to present something - pick a venue and set a date.
If you build it, they will come.</p>
