        <p>Today the Go team is very happy to announce the release of Go 1.16.
You can get it from the <a href="https://golang.google.cn/dl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download page</a>.</p>
<p>The new
<a href="https://golang.google.cn/doc/go1.16#library-embed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embed package</a>
provides access to files embedded at compile time using the new <code>//go:embed</code> directive.
Now it is easy to bundle supporting data files into your Go programs,
making developing with Go even smoother.
You can get started using the
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/embed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embed package documentation</a>.
Carl Johnson has also written a nice tutorial,
“<a href="https://blog.carlmjohnson.net/post/2021/how-to-use-go-embed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to use Go embed</a>”.</p>
<p>Go 1.16 also adds
<a href="https://golang.google.cn/doc/go1.16#darwin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">macOS ARM64 support</a>
(also known as Apple silicon).
Since Apple’s announcement of their new arm64 architecture, we have been working closely with them to ensure Go is fully supported; see our blog post
“<a href="https://TheGoBlog.GitHub.io/ports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go on ARM and Beyond</a>”
for more.</p>
<p>Note that Go 1.16
<a href="https://golang.google.cn/doc/go1.16#modules" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requires use of Go modules by default</a>,
now that, according to our 2020 Go Developer Survey,
96% of Go developers have made the switch.
We recently added official documentation for <a href="https://golang.google.cn/doc/modules/developing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developing and publishing modules</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, there are many other improvements and bug fixes,
including builds that are up to 25% faster and use as much as 15% less memory.
For the complete list of changes and more information about the improvements above,
see the
<a href="https://golang.google.cn/doc/go1.16" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go 1.16 release notes</a>.</p>
<p>We want to thank everyone who contributed to this release by writing code
filing bugs, providing feedback, and testing the beta and release candidate.</p>
<p>Your contributions and diligence helped to ensure that Go 1.16 is as stable as possible.
That said, if you notice any problems, please
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">file an issue</a>.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy the new release!</p>
