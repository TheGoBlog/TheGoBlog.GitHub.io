        <p><strong>October 1, 2019, Update:</strong> <em>The Go Store is currently offline.</em>
<em>We are sorry for any inconvenience.</em>
<em>We will update this post with any status changes.</em></p>
<p>We are excited to launch the new Go official swag and merch store, shipping worldwide.
We are even more excited to announce that <strong>100% of the proceeds</strong> from the Go store go directly to GoBridge.
<a href="https://github.com/gobridge/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoBridge</a> is a non-profit organization focused on building bridges to educate underrepresented groups by teaching technical skills and fostering diversity in the Go community.</p>
