        <p>The Go and App Engine teams are excited to announce that the Go runtime
for App Engine is now generally available.
This means you can take that Go app you&#39;ve been working on (or meaning to
work on) and deploy it to App Engine right now with the new <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.5.2 SDK</a>.</p>
<p>Since we announced the Go runtime at Google I/O we have continued to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/wiki/SdkForGoReleaseNotes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improve and extend</a>
Go support for the App Engine APIs and have added the Channels API.
The Go Datastore API now supports transactions and ancestor queries, too.
See the <a href="https://code.google.com/appengine/docs/go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go App Engine documentation</a>
for all the details.</p>
<p>For those who have been using the Go SDK already,
please note that the 1.5.2 release introduces <code>api_version</code> 2.
This is because the new SDK is based on Go <code>release.r58.1</code> (the current
stable version of Go) and is not backwards compatible with the previous release.
Existing apps may require changes as per the <a href="https://golang.google.cn/doc/devel/release.html#r58" target="_blank" rel="noopener">r58 release notes</a>.
Once you&#39;ve updated your code, you should redeploy your app with the line
<code>api_version: 2</code> in its <code>app.yaml</code> file.
Apps written against <code>api_version</code> 1 will stop working after the 18th of August.</p>
<p>Finally, we owe a huge thanks to our trusted testers and their many bug reports.
Their help was invaluable in reaching this important milestone.</p>
<p><em>The fastest way to get started with Go on App Engine is with the</em> <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/go/gettingstarted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Getting Started guide</em></a>.</p>
<p><em>Note that the Go runtime is still considered experimental; it is not as well-supported as the Python and Java runtimes.</em></p>
