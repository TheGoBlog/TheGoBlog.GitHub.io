        <p>Who says releasing on Friday is a bad idea?</p>
<p>Today the Go team is happy to announce the release of Go 1.11.
You can get it from the <a href="https://golang.google.cn/dl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download page</a>.</p>
<p>There are many changes and improvements to the toolchain,
runtime, and libraries, but two features stand out as being especially exciting:
modules and WebAssembly support.</p>
<p>This release adds preliminary support for a <a href="https://golang.google.cn/doc/go1.11#modules" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new concept called “modules,”</a>
an alternative to GOPATH with integrated support for versioning and package distribution.
Module support is considered experimental,
and there are still a few rough edges to smooth out,
so please make liberal use of the <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issue tracker</a>.</p>
<p>Go 1.11 also adds an experimental port to <a href="https://golang.google.cn/doc/go1.11#wasm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WebAssembly</a> (<code>js/wasm</code>).
This allows programmers to compile Go programs to a binary format compatible with four major web browsers.
You can read more about WebAssembly (abbreviated “Wasm”) at <a href="https://webassembly.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">webassembly.org</a>
and see <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WebAssembly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this wiki page</a> on how to
get started with using Wasm with Go.
Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/neelance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard Musiol</a> for contributing the WebAssembly port!</p>
<p>We also want to thank everyone who contributed to this release by writing code,
filing bugs, providing feedback, and/or testing the betas and release candidates.
Your contributions and diligence helped to ensure that Go 1.11 is as bug-free as possible.
That said, if you do notice any problems, please <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">file an issue</a>.</p>
<p>For more detail about the changes in Go 1.11, see the <a href="https://golang.google.cn/doc/go1.11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Have a wonderful weekend and enjoy the release!</p>
